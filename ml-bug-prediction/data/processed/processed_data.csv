However, if the selected user line is removed from the agent's profile via the dashboard, the conversation list does not refresh automatically. The agent can still see the conversations associated with the removed line, instead of getting a ""No results for search"" message. The filter should refresh as soon as the line is unassigned.|
||*📝 Steps to reproduce*|# Log in as an agent and navigate to the inbox screen.

||*💬 Bug description*|FirebaseLogService stores the instance of Crashlytics when it’s created. However, when the app records first log Crashlytics isn’t configured yet. So FirebaseLogService holds onto an invalid instance of Crashlytics. Therefore crashlogs on Crashlytics is missing most of the breadcrumbs.
\\
You can compare a crash log from Android vs iOS and see that iOS only has screen changes.
\\
Also here is an example iOS crash log with breadcrumb logging fixed: [https://console.firebase.google.com/project/aircall-ffd08/crashlytics/app/ios:com.aircall.Aircall-Staging/issues/8bd48845b60acb7215013139f2ce2c52?time=last-twenty-four-hours&types=crash&sessionEventKey=ab8a70995f2a4c5798f7561c4ee901e9_2045442200705133163|https://console.firebase.google.com/project/aircall-ffd08/crashlytics/app/ios:com.aircall.Aircall-Staging/issues/8bd48845b60acb7215013139f2ce2c52?time=last-twenty-four-hours&types=crash&sessionEventKey=ab8a70995f2a4c5798f7561c4ee901e9_2045442200705133163]|

||*❌ Current result*|Crashes on Crashlytics  doesn’t have breadcrumbs besides screen views.|
||*✅ Expected result*|Crashes on Crashlytics should have breadcrumbs.
\\
Note for QA: We don’t have a way to trigger a crash so I don’t think there is an easy way to check this fix. However, can we make sure a cold app launch is still works as expected as well as receiving a call when the app isn’t running.|

The crash is 100% reproducible on staging release version( not on DEBUG mode).

The crash appears in the version 8.0.0 (develop_5062) (not reproducible before this version)

It seems to be related with changes about ConversationDetailsViewModel.

The AppNavigationPath.swift defines theses entries:

{noformat}    case let .engagements(awConversation):
      ConversationDetailsScreen(viewModel: ConversationDetailsScreenViewModel(awConversation: awConversation))
    case let .conversation(external, lineInformation):
      ConversationDetailsScreen(
        viewModel: ConversationDetailsScreenViewModel(external: external, lineInformation: lineInformation)

Tech Info:

We think the issue comes from this block (used in several places):

{noformat}.map { [contactGateway] payload in
  Future.async {
    let ids = Array(payload.extractAllPossibleIds())
    try await contactGateway.cacheMissingTeammates(ids: ids)
    return payload
  }
  .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
}{noformat}

We suspect a thread issue. It can also be related to the number of update_activity events we are receiving in a short period of time.

We will try several things to fix the crashes:

* Use Swift Concurrency to check the thread lead
* Create a combine version of {{cacheMissingTeammates}} and use it in the Combine stream
* Add a 0.2 sec throttle to mitigate the number of events",27/12/2024 11:36 AM,,,,,,,,Done,,

||*💬 Bug description*|During a cold transfer from an outbound the backend is switching the from and to. As we display what the backend is sending we are displaying the wrong information.
This is definitively a backend bug but it’s not possible to fix it on their side for now (cf Additional remarks)|

||*✅ Expected result*|We should display the right from and to|

||*🗣 Additional remarks*|Regarding the transfer bug:*TL;DR; >6 months of poor customer experience is too long and we should look at a workaround on iOS.* I don’t like it but I’ve weighed up the options and I think it’s the best tradeoff.*Against a backend fix*
* Calls and Routing are currently refactoring Live Call. A fix for this wasn’t, and still isn’t part of the scope of that. However, once that refactor is complete it’s possible to revisit this. The minimum timeline for this is around 4 months. I think more realistically at least 6.
* Live Call is so core to Aircall that messing with it is dangerous. We need to be very VERY cautious in this area.
* This is an incredibly old problem, at least 6 years and the impact has been comparably low.
* The blast radius is very large - a centralised solution is actually very challenging here since over the years, various fixes/workarounds/misunderstandings in various places across many teams have been implemented. The people who implemented these solutions will have forgotten or moved on from Aircall and a lot of the nuance of solutions has been lost.
* Minimally Phone, Android, various integrations and dashboard would need to “unworkaround”. Possibly also data teams, admin portal and others we don’t know about.
* There are likely unknown unknowns for a backend fix
*For a backend fix*
* Centralising the solution means a reduced blast radius in the future
* The data that is stored and presented is accurate.
* No tech debt would be introduced on iOS
*Agnostic comments*
* The customer experience is bad and a fix is needed
* The customer impact is growing with the introduction of Transfer to GSM
* Indeed some customers are requesting growth of this feature already and Edgar has a v2 in mind
*Plan*
*-----*
* Soon: iOS implements a similar workaround to Phone and Android.
* Q1 2025: Reassess the state of Live Call and consider where a fix can be implemented
* *Ideal long term solution:* Backend, fixing the core problem
* *Balanced long term solution:* Internal API (or a versioned rest API, idk where this data is exposed) to centralise a backend solution allowing teams to prepare changes autonomously.
* *Quickest long term solution:* Accepted risk - documented and detailed for future generations of Aircallees!
* New considerations?
*Risks and Mitigation*
*------------------------*
* iOS Tech Debt in the Transfer feature complicates development in this area
* Product: Avoiding feature development in this area where possible
* Engineering: Cautious feature review. Additional code comments.
* QA: Cautious testing in this area.
* Once a workaround is implemented there is no incentive to fix tech debt.
* The debt needs to be measured and understood again - we’ve put a timeline on this - when Live Call refactoring is complete in 4-6 months
* Customers have a continued negative experience because of faulty data
* Cases to be assessed individually using the normal customer support processes|

The player is linked to the liveCall screen that is destroyed quickly now so the player has no time to play the sound.

* Easy fix → play the sound when the call ended appears → not so pertinent since call ended view can not be seen sometimes (pusher events not received)
* *Have an shared audio player and use it to play the sound at the end by using a local notification ?*",,,,,,,,,,,

# Navigate to System Settings → Date & Time → Disable “Set Automatically” for a date.
# From the calendar, select any date 3 months in the future.
# Navigate back to the iOS app. The user will be logged out with the message: {color:#bf2600}“Your session has expired! For your account safety, you have been logged out.”{color}
# Enter the login credentials and click the sign-in button. The user is unable to log in, and every attempt results in the error message: {color:#bf2600}“Your session has expired! For your account safety, you have been logged out.”{color} & {color:#bf2600}“Oops, it looks like you've been disconnected for security purpose”{color} This persists until the user kills the app and reopens it.

The call ended is a particular screen because when we do a call from the call ended the call ended is deleted to display the livecall. So the object that handle the contact resolution is also deleted.",01/12/2022 3:40 PM,,,,,,,,Risk Accepted,,

Currently in *Internal API* we can see several error messages being logged for the {{sendMessage}} mutation when the input has empty text field.  

We were able to verify that the iOS and the Desktop Apps allows the user to send empty messages and probably this can be avoided. 

\[1] Error message example:

{noformat}[Messaging] [Mutation.sendMessage]: Invalid payload: ""text"" is not allowed to be empty{noformat}



For more details to reproduce the error please see the issue [https://aircall-product.atlassian.net/browse/SYS-1289|https://aircall-product.atlassian.net/browse/SYS-1289|smart-link] .

*Why:*

* Decrease Backend load 
* Decrease bandwidth usage
* Decrease log errors messages and noise
* Decrease lambda executions with related cost savings

Tech info : 

1/ Waiting for new Design with Karim (will be refactored to integrate a SMS button) 

2/ Try a modal

3/ Replace with tar bar in SwiftUI

Old tech reflections:

Simple solution : have two navigation header, one for modal and one for navigation

Other solution : in iOS 15 we can use transparent mode for tab bar perhaps ?",04/07/2023 2:17 PM,QRPlan,,,,,,,Risk Accepted,,

Following an issue that wwas raised by the data-platform team

[https://aircall.slack.com/archives/CQNCS522Y/p1643633466403699|https://aircall.slack.com/archives/CQNCS522Y/p1643633466403699|smart-card]

Apparently, on network_quality_warning_clicked segment events, the quality_indicators field is currently being sent as an array by the iOS app, rather than a string. This raises some issue for the data-platform team. Do you think we could get this fixed?

Instead of : 

{{[”high-packet-loss”,”low-volume”]}} 

send

{{""high-packet-loss;low-volume""}}

Thanks in advance

 -- Maybe this is not an issue, it depends of the call distribution for the number. Maybe the call is ringing on another device before. Unfortunately I can't check because the server is down. So I will consider this one as a bug even if I'm not 100% sure -- Aircall QA .

Date decoding fails on history items, which causes multiple issues : 

* History is empty
* Todo is empty (if history not loaded previously)

!Screen Shot 2020-12-15 at 20.21.34.png|width=708,height=109!

We get this error which is an internal error triggered when decoding a custom date.
Date decoding fails when using *iso8601Full* formatter (see *DateFormatterAdditions.swift*)

*Step to reproduce*

# Go to Settings > General > Date & Time > Turn off “Display 24 hours”
# Then try to retrieve the history 💥 

!f19cf642-9272-482f-9dcd-1978e0ae5864|width=888,height=1920!

*How to solve the issue*

It seems because we are not defining a specific locale for the formatter, 
the default device locale is used. This seems causing the issue.
Forcing a specific locale solve the issue

we just need to add the following line

{noformat}formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: ""US""){noformat}

And now we are able to see the history as expected.

*What*
Sometimes we are not able to display the contact name, because the value is empty, or the content is null.. ?
If this occurs, we still have an extra space on the top of the message, which makes the displaying ugly.

If agent name isn’t available we should reduce the bubble height

Metadata request is used to refresh token,
which is essential in order to be able to make inbound calls.

*Problem*
Token is invalidated after 24 hours,
so if the device is off, or app is offline during a long period of time,
we need to request metadata endpoint to retrieve a new token.

When the app is launched, app does automatically metadata request to update token and then user is able to make call. So most of the time we don’t have an issue.

But sometimes, metadata request fails because network connectivity issue or backend problem, then, the token is not updated, and user can’t pass outbound call. The only way to pass outbound calls again is to close and reopen the app.

To prevent this scenario we should be able to retrieve metadata after a network loss or when the app is going to foreground, like we do for teammates, lines etc… on what we call *data synchronization*",30/11/2020 10:33 AM,,,,,,,,Done,,

HistoryScene L.92 : 

{noformat}.overlay(loader){noformat}

(This is the view responsible for displaying the loader animation when HistoryScene is loading initial data. It’s not supposed to be a problem because we display the KeypadScene first, and the HistoryScene is not visible initially.)

*What*
When the user launches the app and arrives on HomeScene (the view where all tabs are visible), we notice that the CPU usage is at 100% which is absolutely not expected... This use the battery for nothing… and make the app unresponsive.. When user clicks on another tab, then, the CPU usage go back to something normal : 0% if user does nothing. So until, the user select another tab, or display another view the CPU usage is high.
{color:#ff5630}Please note that the issue occurs only on iOS 14 and not iOS 13.{color}

*Steps to reproduce*

* Launch the app and see how cpu usage is high

*Solution*

Keep the current behavior on iOS 13, but change the behavior on iOS 14 : Not using the Aircall loader, but use the system one (it works fine the native iOS loader). Be sure to make the primary color for the loader.",27/10/2020 5:35 PM,,,,,,,,Fixed,,

PeopleScene and Local contacts management

*What*
Local contact management is not well implemented, which makes the app consuming too much memory, and makes at a certain point, the app unresponsive, and very slow.
Some users are complaining about the issue which makes the app totally unusable. When then stop local contact synchronisation, the app works well as expected.


*Steps to reproduce*
Use a device with more than 1.000 contacts makes the issue visible. Please note that some users have so much contacts on their phone (more +5.000\!)

🚨This cannot be tested on personal device, because, it will pollute the device contacts so seriously, that we can’t do that… We need to find a way to create many users randomly, with fake names, numbers, emails, and create a file to make it importable directly by the phone. 🚨 ",08/11/2020 7:30 PM,,,,,,,,Fixed,,

KeypadScene (CountryScene & LineScene)

*What*
Sometimes if you are playing with keyboard on CountryScene & LineScene, we can break the UI on KeypadScene, which make the view really broken, and which can break the whole app after.

In addition when you hide CountryScene & LineScene, when keyboard is open, you can see a strange effect, making the keypad moving.

PreferenceScene

*What*
Actions to manipulate permissions on PermissionScene are confusing for users : Many testers (Applause, but also Internal) are complaining that something is not working whereas it’s the attended behavior… So it’s deceptive for both users and development teams.

What we have today : 

* *Allow* in green : When user clicks on it, user is invited to allow permission
* *Disallow* in red : When user clicks on it, user is invited to disallow permission


We have multiple options here to fix the issue : 

# The simplest way : change wording.
Allow -> Grant
Disallow -> Revoke

Advantage : Nothing to change, only wording on Lokalise, and maybe it’s more understandable by the user…
Cons : Maybe user will still don’t understand


2. Having dots indicating the current status permission and redirect to user settings or ask the permission if the user clicks on the whole cell

Advantage : Having a status is more understandable
Cons : Click on the cell is not obvious

2. Tap on Keypad
3. Type an invalid number (+44 2039665949##0)
4. Hit Call button
5. Wait call starts
6. Pay attention to the voice message

---- ACTION DETAILS ----

Action Performed:
1. Install app.
2. Launch app
3. Log in using aircall_bts+16@applauseplatform.com
4. Allow permission so that all device features and contacts can be used by the app
5. Go to the keypad section and try to dialing a few known contacts (numbers used - 07523646029, 07812329532.

Expected Result:
Call will be established and conversation can start

Actual Result:
No call is established. App says the number is invalid. Valid numbers are reported as invalid and call gets disconnected. The numbers appear as +07523646029, +07812329532.
Now if the number is chosen as 4475236029, then it becomes +447523646029 and the call gets established.

A number starting with 0 followed by the actual number is a valid UK mobile calling format. App is not supporting that as it seems.

Additional Info:
undefined

Error Code/Message:

---- ACTION DETAILS ----

Action Performed:
1. Open the application
2. Touch the Keyboard tab
3. Enter the user's own number (+44 20 3966 5949) > hit Call icon
4. Wait for the call to start
5. After starts, wait few seconds (about 5 seconds)
6. Press End button
7. Wait 5-10 seconds. Observe

Expected Result:
User expects to end the call and don't receive any call back

Actual Result:
After ending the call, user receives an incoming call from the same number ended just before (+44 20 3966 5949)

Replicability: 3/5 (each 5 attempts, issue occurred 3 times)

Note: after receives the call back, user can’t finishes the call even by hitting on end button (video 3.mp4 attached). To reuse the app normally, user must to kill the app and open it again

Additional Info:
As soon as you receive a call, the screen recording stops automatically. Therefore, I was unable to show the entire Action Performed in only one video. So, I attached screenshots/videos in right sequence (1, 2, 3, 4) to show entire action and issue occurred.

An external camera could be better to show this problem, but because of the COVID-19 quarantine, I don't have access to an external camera now

---- ACTION DETAILS ----

Action Performed:
1. Install Aircall app
2. Launch and login to the app (user 16)
3. Go to the keypad to make an outbound call
4. Check the area where the inserted number appears

Expected Result:
User can select the country to call by tapping on the section where the inserted number appears.

Actual Result:
There is no way of identifying that the user can select the country to call i.e. choice of country. The whole upper section where the dialled number appears is of the same white colour and there is no demarcation. Only if the user taps to the left of that section that he realises that he can actually select a country and the country flag appears over there. 
The flag again goes off on restarting the app though. I have conducted all my tests without even knowing that I could select UK as the country. 

The needs to be some indication that a user can select the country.

Sometimes, when user tries to login, the user keeps blocked on the page.
+Symptom+
User clicks on login button and nothing happens :
view is not notified by error or success, so loading is infinite…
This is really annoying because you can try many times, reinstalling the app, with no success, and the problem persist, and suddenly, the problem disappears, without doing anything. *This is really problematic :* without the deviceId, you cannot receive inbound calls, you cannot register, you cannot use the app…
Please note the problem appears not often, but when it’s come it’s absolutely blocking.

Please note : 
If you are offline, the error message is not displayed : the login request is not made.
The problem appears because we couldn’t get the deviceId.

PeopleDetailsScene (for teammate contact)

*What*
Now clicking on the phone number from PeopleDetailsScene call back directly, so we don’t need to have a call back button here anymore.

Whereas the callback button has been removed for simple phone numbers, the button is still present for internal call. We should remove it.

To avoid multiple request when user retrieved history items, we should retrieve items 50 by 50.

Once you receive history items and display them in HistoryScene everything is fine.

But if you relaunch the app, then we refetch history items again, and then duplicate entries will be visible in HistoryScene. If you save the context, then because history id are identical just one is saved.

But as soon as you relaunch the app you will see duplicate entries again and again.

*Solution*
Be sure to update history items if they already exist before creating new ones.

KeypadScene

*What*
Sometimes, when we retrieve user lines, they are not displayed properly on the KeypadScene.

This leads to make the user think he has no lines configured on his account which is wrong \!
Furthermore, with no lines, it’s impossible to make a call.

We can see this is a refresh problem, because if user display the CountryScene, then KeypadScene is refreshed and user is now able to see his own lines.

*Steps to reproduce*
Change L.52 on RouterScene to

{code:swift}HomeScene(viewModel: .init(selection: .keypad)){code}

And you will have more change to reproduce the issue

On *KeypadScene*, just open the *CountryScene*, you will see that there is an update of *LineSelectorView* which causes the view to refresh and then have a temporary state where the color changed from one line (black) to multiple lines (green).


*Solution*
Better handling the reload, or check if value has changed. Maybe use equatable for this one, to avoid redraw

the data displayed is updated live to reflect the changes.
Here we are displaying the data from the local database.

The problems occurs when we want start a search.
The teammate are now retrieved from backend, and the backend don’t provide real and live informations about user status.. So when we search all teammates status are set to offline which is wrong. Furthermore, if picture or name changes, data is not updated live.

Finally when we stop the search, and display the list again, we loose the status informations…

We need to discard teammates informations when we are making a search.

One of the features of iOS is that it takes a screenshot of the application when it enters into background.

Aircall iOS application has not properly implemented security mechanism for side channel data leakage which allows attacker to access victim’s user credentials.

1. Download the application files using tools like 'ifunbox' or 'iexplorer'. 
2. Then navigate to directory Aircall/Library/Caches/Snapshots/com.aircall.Aircall/
➜ downscaled

h4. Suggested Fix
•	Remove sensitive information from views before moving to the background. When an application transitions to the background, the system takes a snapshot of the application’s main window, which it then presents briefly when transitioning your application back to the foreground. 
•	Before returning from your applicationDidEnterBackground: method, you should hide or obscure passwords and other sensitive personal information that might be captured as part of the snapshot.

We should put the status bar to white on LiveCallScene and put it back to dark when the view is dismissed.

There is an issue with InCallScene and InCallScene+ViewModel.
When we are in call, each time we change the duration of the call,
the observed object causes a rebuild of HomeScene body, which causes an expected rebuild of each scene embedded in TabBarController.

*What*
When user pass a call, phone number is saved and user is able to call the last number by clicking the call button (green) on keypad.

The problem is a confidentiality issue : When user is disconnected, we must reset the last number. Then, when user login again, and clicks on call button with an empty number, no last number should be available.

PeopleScene

*What*
Today, when we are doing a search for teammates we are using API. Unfortunately we loose informations.
When we display the teammates in the list, data is live : 
If status change and/or name and/or picture change,
the data displayed is updated live to reflect the changes.
Here we are displaying the data from the local database.

The problems occurs when we want start a search.
The teammate are now retrieved from backend, and the backend don’t provide real and live informations about user status.. So when we search all teammates status are set to offline which is wrong. Furthermore, if picture or name changes, data is not updated live.

Finally when we stop the search, and display the list again, we loose the status informations…

*Solution*
We need to discard teammates informations when we are making a search.
We should search teammates from DB (CoreData) instead of API. 
Search via API must be only used with Company contacts.

If we land to login page, and try to login whereas there is no connection, the loader Is loading infinity. User can’t understand what’s happens, and the login button state never goes back, and no error message is displayed

*Solution*
When user try to login without network we should : 

* Display an error message with feedback message
* Stop loader
* Enable again login button


⚠️ This can causes an issue if user has network issue

User has the possibility to change few informations regarding his account : 

* Picture
* Firstname
* Lastname

Today, when user wants to change only first name and last name, everything works properly : 

* If both fields are not empty
AND
* If one or both fields content is different from actual value

=> Then the save button is enabled and the network request to change these values can be made. Otherwise the button is disabled and nothing can happens;

In addition, about the picture management : 

* if user don’t changes first name and last name
* user changes the picture

=> Then the save button is enabled and the network request to change these values can be made.

*The problem*

If user make first name or last name empty (or both) and then change the picture : The button save is enabled whereas it mustn’t.

=> This allows the user to save empty first name and last name whereas it’s normally impossible \!

*Solution*

If first name and last name are empty, save button should be always disable doesn’t matter if the picture has been changed or not

*What*
Whereas on iOS 13, the feedback message is displayed properly when an error (or success) message appears on script, on iO14 a strange glitch make the feedback message experience very poor, because now :

* Animation of displaying and removing the message on screen seems broken
* The 2 sec animation used to inform the user that the message will disappears is broken
* Feedback message position is broken.

=> Too many things broken here. We need to understand why.


*Steps to reproduce*

* 1) Go to the KeypadScene
* 2) Go to CountryScene
* 3) Turn Airplane mode ON
* 4) Try to set a country as default

Because we are now able to switch language at the runtime in the app, we don’t follow the language configuration for the app from settings.

If we select for exemple Spanish language from Device’s settings > App > Language, and we configure a different language from the app itself, to French.

When user, display the device gallery, it will be in Spanish whereas the app is in French.
