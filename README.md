# üêû ML Bug Risk Prediction Project

This project demonstrates a complete, step-by-step machine learning workflow for predicting high-risk software bugs using historical bug data and component risk scoring. By leveraging data-driven analytics and ML models, QA teams can proactively identify and prioritize bugs that are most likely to impact product quality.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:QAPournima/ML-Predicting-Bugs.git
   cd ML-Predicting-Bugs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare your data:**
   - Place raw bug data in `data/raw/`.
   - Run preprocessing scripts or use the notebook to generate processed data.

4. **Run the notebook:**
   - Open `notebooks/Bug Risk Prediction Demo - Step-by-Step ML Workflow.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
   - Follow the workflow cells to train, evaluate, and interpret the bug risk prediction model.

## üß† ML Workflow Overview

The main notebook walks through these steps:

1. **Data Loading:**  
   Loads historical bug data from CSV files.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   Calculates risk scores for each bug/component and creates one-hot encoded features.

3. **Data Preparation:**  
   Combines features, defines the target variable (high risk or not), and splits data into training and test sets.

4. **Model Training:**  
   Trains Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers to predict high-risk bugs.

5. **Prediction:**  
   Uses trained models to predict risk on test data.

6. **Evaluation:**  
   Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

7. **Results Visualization:**  
   Visualizes feature importance and risk distribution.

8. **Interpretability:**  
   Explains which components are most associated with high risk and provides human-readable explanations for predictions.

## üìä Example: Bug Risk Analysis Report

- **Component Risk Scoring:**  
  Components are ranked by historical bug frequency and assigned risk scores (high, moderate, low).
- **Visualizations:**  
  Pie charts, summary tables, and risk scoring tables highlight high-risk areas.
- **Actionable Insights:**  
  Focus QA and development efforts on components most likely to cause issues.

---

## üí° How This Supports Predictive QA

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Risk scores and component histories become features for ML models.
- **Continuous Learning:**  
  As new bugs are reported, retrain models for improved accuracy.
- **Prioritization:**  
  Automatically flag and prioritize high-risk bugs for review and testing.

## üìö Usage Examples

- **Preprocess data:**
  ```python
  from src.data_preprocessing import preprocess_data
  preprocess_data('data/raw/bugs.csv')
  ```

- **Train the model:**
  ```python
  from src.model_training import train_model
  train_model('data/processed/processed_data.csv')
  ```

- **Evaluate the model:**
  ```python
  from src.model_evaluation import evaluate_model
  evaluate_model('data/processed/processed_data.csv')
  ```
